# Exploring

So seems it starts with a web page. Let's take a look first.

![page](/img/sunglass-page.png)

This looks like a IM, and a friend talks about sending a file from a website http://storage.zoop. Let's poke around.

When I click on "Attach" button, a dialog shows up. It allows me to input a URL of the storage.zoop website, and I can even preview the file of the URL I input.

# The *Attach* Dialog

Well, let's try the file mentioned by our friend first.

Wow. Such anger. So fierce. ![doge](https://atipsewa.sirv.com/doge.jpg?w=40)


But I just can't resist to try again with file name `flag.txt` in that URL.



And... TADA!
